# selenium python  script to unlike tweets on twitter.com
I was recently trying to mass unlike tweets on twitter manually, and remembered im a programmer and i can write a python script to do that for me automatically, so i wrote this script using selenium 4.

# run locally
To use this script you can clone this repo locally, I'd recommend activating a python3 virtual venv, install the requiremnts.txt file and fill in your username and password in the code.
